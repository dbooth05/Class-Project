08/31 11:00 Created file to hold main and terrain generation work
08/31 17:00 Created Struct object to contain data for each space on map
09/01 10:45 Created loop to randomly initialize starting points to generate terrain from
09/01 14:00 Started working on function to fill in the border as "%"
09/05 09:30 Fixed issues with terrainType in structure (pointers), then finished setBorder() and printGrid() methods
09/05 12:00 Fixed issue of double parenthesis being printed on end of map in printGrid(). Started work on a queue for generating map
09/05 15:30 Using a queue system, will fill in rest of grid and fill elevation values. Started path generation work selecting spots for
    path at border.
09/06 10:45 Work on path generation, changes how start/end spots are chosen
09/08 10:45 Work on path gen, start making vertical path between start and end
09/09 23:00 The north/south and east/west path generation is working
09/10 11:30 Generation of the Poke Center and Poke Mart on path now added
09/10 01:22 Added and fixed comments to be more descriptive of what function is doing
09/11 22:45 Moved all queue structure to queue.h and queue.c, also changed the queue structure to be more similar to queue created in class
09/12 16:00 finished altering the code to queue structure in class. Also fixed bug in code during generation.
09/14 10:00 reworking the struct terrain to allow future progression. redoing alot of code from assignment1-01
09/14 10:45 got halfway restructuing with the differnt terrain structure
09/14 16:20 Finished restructuring and now am back to a working state in terrain/path generation. Started work with predesignated gates.
09/14 23:30 Started movement between map segments. Some bugs with getting right memory, but kinda works.
09/15 11:10 Finished path generation with correct gates locations between map segments. On world border, no gates are placed.
09/15 13:45 Fixed issue with memory, initialized all elements of struct terrain map[][] prior.
09/15 20:00 Finished adding all required functions for assignment. Building spawning chanced reduced with distance from center.
09/20 10:30 Started working on adding a heap structure, heap.c & heap.h
09/26 09:30 Addded struct for character and started work on implementation.
09/27 20:45 Finished implementing spawning of trainers and PC.
09/27 21:50 Started work on filling the cost map using Dijkstras.
09/29 10:15 Added colors to printing in the terminal, easier to find trainters/npc
