8/31 11:00 Created file to hold main and terrain generation work
8/31 17:00 Created Struct object to contain data for each space on map
9/01 10:45 Created loop to randomly initialize starting points to generate terrain from
9/01 14:00 Started working on function to fill in the border as "%"
9/05 09:30 Fixed issues with terrainType in structure (pointers), then finished setBorder() and printGrid() methods
9/05 12:00 Fixed issue of double parenthesis being printed on end of map in printGrid(). Started work on a queue for generating map
9/05 15:30 Using a queue system, will fill in rest of grid and fill elevation values. Started path generation work selecting spots for
    path at border.
9/06 10:45 Work on path generation, changes how start/end spots are chosen
9/08 10:45 Work on path gen, start making vertical path between start and end
9/09 23:00 The north/south and east/west path generation is working
9/10 11:30 Generation of the Poke Center and Poke Mart on path now added
9/10 01:22 Added and fixed comments to be more descriptive of what function is doing
9/11 22:45 Moved all queue structure to queue.h and queue.c, also changed the queue structure to be more similar to queue created in class
9/12 16:00 finished altering the code to queue structure in class. Also fixed bug in code during generation.
9/14 10:00 reworking the struct terrain to allow future progression. redoing alot of code from assignment1-01
9/14 10:45 got halfway restructuing with the differnt terrain structure
9/14 16:20 Finished restructuring and now am back to a working state in terrain/path generation. Started work with predesignated gates.
9/14 23:30 Started movement between map segments. Some bugs with getting right memory, but kinda works.
9/15 11:10 Finished path generation with correct gates locations between map segments. On world border, no gates are placed.
9/15 13:45 Fixed issue with memory, initialized all elements of struct terrain map[][] prior.
9/15 20:00 Finished adding all required functions for assignment. Building spawning chanced reduced with distance from center.
