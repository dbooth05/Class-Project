Generates a pokemon world (401x401) in segments where the segment (80x21) is only
    generated if the player moves into that segment if it has not been previously 
    generated, and matches all gates positions so they match between different 
    segments. Building locations also have reduced chances of spawning the greater 
    the manhattan distance from the center. Gates are not generated on edge of world.
    Also, commands to move between segments to explore the world can be used.
