# COM S 227 - Object-oriented Programming

This was my first class at Iowa State University. This class introduced Java and Object Oriented coding. I already had experience in Java prior to this class starting. Included in the provided Java Projects are some spec checkers, automated tests, otherwise they may have a simple tests code files.

## Assignment 1
This was a simple project to introduce Java concepts, it is a project to track occupancy of the Cyride bus system, the campus bus service, as it would make it's route. The challenge to this assignment was to use no conditional statements.

## Assignment 2
Corkball, a fake offbrand baseball was this project, simply put, it was a state tracker to keep and display game states. An example of how the code words is provided in SimpleTests.java

## Assignment 3
To continue developing more complexity and incorporating more Object-oriented code, this project was to make a version of Snake, this version instead was a puzzle to make the fewest moves to move one snake to an escape point. The GUI portion of this assignment was provided by the instructors as GUIs are not a taught subject yet.

## Assignment 4
The final assignment was focussed on Polymorphism and Inheritance within Object-oriented design. The project incorporated Abstract classes and many layers of inheritance to produce a graphical game. Again, the GUI was designed and provided by instructors.

## Mini Assignments
These assignments were just small programming "tests" in between exams and assignments. They are simple and easy assignments to practice object-oriented programming.
