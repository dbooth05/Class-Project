# COM S 327

This class over the course of the semester developed a version of Pokemon. The project is terminal based. This class started with all projects being in the C programming language (booth_dylan.assignment-0 - booth_dylan.assignment-1.05). For the remaining assignements, the language used is C++. For user input and graphical display, Ncurses was used.

There is more specific information about controls and features for each assignment in the individual README files. The final project is under the booth_dylan.assignment-1.10-2 directory. 

In order to run the project, simply clone or download repository, then using the terminal go to directory where cloned repo is and open folder of project you wish to run. Compile project by running the command "make" and then once compiled run command "./poke327".

You will also need to download the .poke327 directory, this directory contains all databases and correct paths to find all pokemon information for the project.
