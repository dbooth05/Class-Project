# COM S 363 - Intro to Databases

This class introduced and covered many database types and concepts. The class projects stored in this repository covered MySQL, Neo4j, and MongoDB concepts. This class also covered concepts of scheduling, warehouse management, and data mining.

## Project 1
Introduced MySQL concepts like setting up, starting, filling, and querying a local hosted MySQL database. All .sql files were ran in toolkits like MySQL Workbench or Jetbrain's Datagrip.

## Project 1B
Continuation of MySQL concepts except was connecting, and querying a SQL database using Java code.

## Project 2
Project 2 was dedicated to graph databases, specifically Neo4j. All queries were ran in the web interface as commands, hence they are stored in txt files. Data used for the assignment are provided.

## Project 3
In continuation of covering multiple different database management systems, the last DBMS covered was Mongo DB. This project was ran on a MongoDB Atlas server, because of this the username, password, and IP field have been removed. This project part B implements a Apriori algorithm.
