# COMS 228 - Introduction to Data Structures
During this course, topics covered were Sorting Algrorithms and Advanced Data Structures. Throughout this course trees, hash maps, linked lists, doubly linked lists were some of the Data Structures covered.

Included in this sub-repo includes 3 assignments from the course.

## Assignment 1: Prarie Simulator
This program simulates prairie life using Polymorphism and Inheritance. Based on set rules, user input or predesigned scenarios.

## Assignment 2: Sorting Algorithms
Included are 4 sorting algorithms: Selection, Insertion, Merge, and Quicksort. Code can randomly create arrays of Points then sort the arrays using each of the 4 algorithms and displays how fast each algorithm runs.

## Assignment 3: Linked Lists
Implements Doubly-Linked list with dummy head and tail nodes. Also implemented is a ListIterator to work through the list. Many functions are implemented based off of an Abstract Class.
